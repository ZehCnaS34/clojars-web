  <h2 id="account-termination-policy-for-repeat-infringers">Account Termination Policy for Repeat Infringers</h2>

  <p>Clojars will terminate any account that infringes other parties' copyrights three times in a rolling 365-day
    window. An infringement occurs when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Clojars receives a valid notice to take down material, and the account holder does not respond to it within 14
      days; or</p></li>
    <li><p>a court rules the account holder distributed infringing material on Clojars, and the ruling is not
      appealed.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Clojars may also terminate accounts when it determines the account holder has engaged in willful or egregious
    infringement, negatively impacting the service.</p>
